		Your institution faces data security regulations and scrutiny from all corners. Every day its reputation — and yours — is on the line. All it takes is one disclosure or media report of data loss or theft to cause irreparable harm. Websense&reg; Data Security Suite simplifies your compliance efforts and helps protect your customers' sensitive data.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Identify, locate, and protect confidential data.</b> Data Security Suite starts by identifying your sensitive data by using content classifiers, scanning deep into your networks to find and help protect confidential data.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Create policies with easy-to-use templates.</b> Data Security Suite helps you manage your compliance with regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Built-in templates remove the guesswork from policy creation and let you readily customize policies to fit your institution.*
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Respond quickly to data security emergencies</b>. There's no downtime when data is lost or stolen or you're hit with an audit. Data Security Suite empowers you to respond quickly to these and other security incidents.
