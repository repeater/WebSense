		<h1>Hybrid</h1>
        <h2>Combine deployment options and manage on a single console.</h2>
        <p>
        <b>Websense TruHybrid™ deployment offers the best of all worlds.</b> Get the unique advantages of both in-the-cloud and on-premises information security — and manage the entire system from a single console. TruHybrid deployment solves several key web security challenges by:
        </p>
        <ul class="standard">
            <li>Providing high-capacity appliances or software to meet the demands of large offices. </li>
            <li>Using the cloud to secure smaller satellite offices that lack the technical resources to support hardware. </li>
            <li>Securing mobile users in the cloud so there's no need to route traffic back to a central location. </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h4>TruHybrid offers advantageous email security: </h4>
        <ul class="standard">
            <li>Bulk inbound email is filtered in the cloud, reducing your need for on-premises hardware to carry the load </li>
            <li>Websense V-Series™ appliances provide control for customized policies, granular reporting and outbound data loss prevention (DLP) </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul class="standard">
            <li><b>Web security that's high-performance yet simple and flexible</b>. V-Series appliances protect large offices, while cloud-based security is easily extended to remote offices and mobile users. Manage both platforms from a single console using one policy and reporting system. </li>
            <li><b>Maximized bandwidth and reliability</b>. Spam filtering happens in the cloud, so you can free up local server bandwidth and reduce the risk of your servers going down during spikes in email traffic.</li>
            <li><b>Unified management and reporting</b>. The Websense&reg; TRITON™ Unified Security Center consolidates management of cloud-based and on-premises security, cutting the costs associated with other hybrid deployments that have separate management systems. </li>
            <li><b>Websense Hybrid High Availability for web</b>. In the event a web security appliance goes offline, Hybrid High Availability automatically reroutes your web traffic to the nearest Websense data center – with no interruption in web security. </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
