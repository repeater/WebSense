		<h1>Certified TRITON&trade; Integrator</h1>
        <h2>Maximize your Websense&reg; TRITON&trade; solution deployment.</h2>
        <p>Websense&reg; TRITON™ solutions combine unique features for unparalleled security, simplicity, and economy. Engage a Certified TRITON Integrator (CTI) to maximize your ROI and take full advantage of what TRITON has to offer.</p>
		<p>A CTI can help ensure that:</p>
		<ul class="standard">
			<li>Your solution is deployed efficiently and effectively. </li>
			<li>Your security policies are optimized. </li>
			<li>Your installation delivers precisely what you need from it. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Websense has developed an extensive roster of these specialized and certified CTI partners. They are required to meet and maintain rigorous standards, which include: </p>
		<ul class="standard">
			<li>Having on staff at least one Certified TRITON Gladiator. This is a partner engineer who has achieved the status of a Certified TRITON Olympian and has been shadowed by a Websense engineer on a previous customer installation. </li>
			<li>Sending customers a survey at the completion of each and every engagement. </li>
			<li>Maintaining an average customer survey score of 4 out of 5. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Websense stands behind its CTIs, and you stand to reap the benefits. Our close partnerships include priority support, ongoing certification requirements, and a one-on-one relationship between a Websense engineer and corresponding Certified TRITON Gladiator.</p>

			“CTIs have helped hundreds of Websense customers, from small businesses to global enterprises, deploy their Websense TRITON solutions. Let a competent and capable CTI help with your TRITON deployment to simplify your solution and maximize your ROI.”
