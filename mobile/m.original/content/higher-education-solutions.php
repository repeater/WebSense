        <p>Higher education networks face high web and email traffic, exposing them to malware threats and data loss. Websense<sup>&reg;</sup> information security products provide protection without decreasing performance. They offer:</p>
        <ul class="standard tight">
            <li>Real-time, inline defense against advanced threats.</li>
            <li>State-of-the-art data loss prevention (DLP).</li>
            <li>Efficient policy enforcement and compliance.</li>
            <li>Reduced cost with highly scalable appliances and a unified solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Protect networks and data against advanced threats.</h4>
        <p>Students, faculty and staff expect unimpeded web access. But social media and other technologies expose your institution to advanced threats. Fortunately, the Websense TRITON&trade; architecture enables unparalleled protection against such dangers.</p>
        <p>The TRITON&trade; architecture underlies all our information security products. It’s powered by <a href="websense-advanced-classification-engine.php">Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine)</a>, which uses a composite scoring model with seven defense assessment areas to provide real-time protection. ACE also offers predictive analysis informed by more than 10,000 analytics.</p>
        <h4>Protect data from unauthorized access and loss.</h4>
        <p>Websense DLP technologies help keep your confidential data confidential and ensure regulatory compliance. Our outbound data protection includes many industry firsts, such as:</p>
        <ul class="tight standard">
            <li>Optical character recognition (OCR) that recognizes text within image files.</li>
            <li>“Drip” DLP that can detect cumulative, “low and slow” data leaks. </li>
            <li>Detection of attempts to steal password data files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Enforce policies and ensure regulatory compliance.</h4>
        <p>Websense can help secure the health information, student records and other confidential data you’re required to protect. Our products contain more than 1,600 easy-to-use policies and templates to simplify your school’s compliance.</p>
        <h4>Reduce network complexity.</h4>
        <p>Our TRITON architecture, with its unified interface for web, email, data and mobile security, significantly reduces network and operational complexity. In addition, highly scalable Websense appliances offer network throughput of up to 5 Gbps* per appliance, enabling you to secure even the highest capacity network using fewer appliances.</p>
        <h4>Save money without compromising security.</h4>
        <p>Websense helps you reduce your costs in two distinct ways:</p>
        <ul class="tight standard">
            <li>Our TRITON architecture simplifies product and vendor management by unifying web, email, data and mobile security solutions. </li>
            <li>With Websense TruHybrid&trade; deployment, you can take advantage of the best features of software, appliance and cloud platforms to protect all your students, faculty and staff in all locations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Performance may vary depending on network conditions.</p>
